Hello! 
My name is Sourya Paul, or I go by the alias _retr0_ sometimes. 

Who am I? - Well I like developing small projects using AI capabilities. I am still learning and there is a lot to learn, whoa - reality check!. But, hey! I do have some tricks up my sleeve. For eg, I am deeply passionate about and skilled in Python, I use Python for most of my API calls and Data Analysis and Visualization. I am currently learning ML and NLP.
I am adept at Gen-AI tools and their use cases. Send a hi for some pep talk.
